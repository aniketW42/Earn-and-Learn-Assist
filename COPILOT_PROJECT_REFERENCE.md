- **Fix**: Added `@login_required` decorator to prevent unauthorized access
- **Location**: `scheme/views.py` line 173

#### 2. **Fixed Dangerous Database Query** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Used `objects.get()` which could crash on missing records
- **Fix**: Replaced with `get_object_or_404()` for graceful error handling
- **Location**: `scheme/views.py` in `student_dashboard` view

#### 3. **Improved Work Log Rejection System** ‚úÖ

- **Changes**:
  - Added `is_rejected`, `rejection_reason`, `rejected_by` fields to `WorkLog` model
  - Updated `reject_work_log` view to use soft delete
  - Modified queries to filter out rejected logs appropriately
- **Migration**: `scheme/migrations/0005_*.py`

#### 4. **Enhanced Database Performance** ‚úÖ

- **Location**: `users/views.py` in `student_signup` function

#### 7. **Added File Type Validation** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: No file type restrictions on document uploads
- **Fix**: Added separate validators for images and PDFs
